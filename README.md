#  Clustering with Fuzzy Logic on Iris

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length,and petal width) and a target label indicating the species of iris.
Our goal is to cluster the samples into different groups based on these features.
