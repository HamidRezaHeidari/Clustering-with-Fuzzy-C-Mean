# ðŸ“–Fuzzy C-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

This repository presents a **Python implementation of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm** applied to the classic Iris dataset. Fuzzy C-Means is a soft clustering method where each data point can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. This project demonstrates how to implement FCM from scratch, visualize clustering results, and evaluate performance using the **Calinski-Harabasz Index**.
The implementation is fully modular and easy to adapt for other datasets or experiments. The repository includes helper functions, scripts for running the algorithm, and visualization tools for exploring the clustering outcomes.

## ðŸ§­About Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones, gradually learning an optimal policy to achieve a goal. In this project, RL trains the robot arm to reach the target efficiently and accurately.
